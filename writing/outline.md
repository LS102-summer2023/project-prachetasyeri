### Research Project Details

* What is the focus of your research project?

Build, design and implement a prototype using computer vision and machine learning to help doctors understand patients emotions, and degree of pain to aid in diagnosis of diseases in a virtual consultation.

* State at least one research question that your project will answer.

Can facial expressions be analyzed to draw out emotions to aid in better diagnosis in virtual consultation sessions between medical caregivers and patients?


* What are the steps you will need to take to complete this project?

PHASE 1:

- Finalize tools and datasets required for the project (Google Colab, python, image dataset, faker.ai, compencv)
- Conduct exploratory data analysis(Dpendent, independant, missing data, outliers data incostencies)
- Establish emotion indices on face images from the internet
- Write code to arrive at approximate emotion states(happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- Correlate emotions states with pain index
- Validate model and analyze model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)

PHASE 2:
- Source Video data
- Convert video to threaded images
- Repeat phase 1 analysis on video (accuracy of model, precision, etc)

PHASE 3: (OUt OF SCOPE)
- Extend the analysis to near real time video sessions (Facetime, Google Meet)
