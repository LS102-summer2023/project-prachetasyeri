### Abstract

TODO: This section describes your  research project, including the overall aims and the background motivating your research. Whenever possible, you should use one or more concrete examples and technical diagrams.

It is often useful and necessary to separate the introduction into multiple sections. Several possible sections are proposed below, you can use these or distribute your introductory text into sections in another way.

The headings below propose one way you might structure this section of the document.

#### Motivation
During the global COVID-19 pandemic, my grandpa suffered from Alzheimer's and Leukemia. He was in a weakened state of health. Coronavirus exposure would have been undesirable to his health. I wondered if we could engage in online consultations with his doctors. Although possible, I quickly understood that online sessions would not be an adequate method compared to face-to-face interactions. I speculated ways in which online consultation between doctors and patients could be improved to help in the diagnosis of diseases and be more effective. If online consultations were more reliable, here are a few ways the public would benefit:

1. Patients may have a primary doctor whom they see regularly and such a doctor would be familiar with their medical history. In these cases, the patient would be able to consult their preferred doctor over the Internet and have a just as effective consultation.

2. Accessibility of medical services would be increased and would benefit patients without easy access to good medical services. They would be able to reach a qualified doctor and get treated remotely.

3. Patients would be able to get multiple opinions from doctors with completely different perspectives. This could include doctors from different backgrounds, qualifications, and doctors from different countries.

4. According to Infoplease as of August 4, 2020, there were only 2 physicians per 100,000 people in Tanzania whereas in Cuba there were 591 physicians per 100,000 people. If online consultations are feasible, the ratio of physicians to patients would be drastically increased improving the medical state of the world.
#### Current State of the Art

#### Goals of the Project

### Related work

Emotion detection has been a prevelant field of research and recently has been popular in various applications. Previously emotion detection has been used to enhance interactions between human-robot interactions.

### Prototype

TODO: This section describes the implemented prototype - how did you implement your prototype, including the overall design of your prototype, details of the algorithms and tools if any used, etc. Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

### Experiments

TODO: This section describes your experimental set up and evaluation. It should also produce and describe the results of your study. The subsection titles below offer a typical structure used for this section.

#### Experimental Design

TODO: Especially as it pertains to responsible computing, if conducting experiments or evaluations that involve particular ethical considerations, detail those issues here.

#### Evaluation

TODO

#### Threats to Validity

TODO: What are some considerations and choices you have made during your project that might compromise some of your presented results (for example, if you are using data could there be sources of data inaccuracy, or if you are relying on an existing tool or library, a potential inaccuracy in their work might result to inaccuracy in yours).

### Conclusion

TODO: Traditionally, this section addresses the areas proposed below as subsections, although not necessarily in this order or organized as offered.

#### Summary of Results
