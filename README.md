# LS 102 - Computer Science: Research Paper

## Objectives

* To introduce, motivate, and explain a research project in terms of its scope, feasibility, developed prototype, and preliminary results from run experiments.
* To write a convincing research paper that showcases the excellence of your project. 

---

## Main Ideas

In this assignment, you are to  write a basic draft of your research paper (at least 2000 words) in which you discuss the following main ideas.

1. What is the area of your research in your proposed project idea? What is your specific proposed idea and why is it important? Motivate with references as relevant.
2. What is already known in the literature about this problem area; where does your projectâ€™s concentration of your own interests lie in this area? What goals have you set for this project? Motivate with references as relevant.
3. What is the Gap between the field and the knowledge of the area? Why is this gap present and what are the implications of the gap and what is your solution to try to bridge this gap? Motivate with references as relevant.
4. Using specifics, what is/are the research question(s) that motivate your research project?
5. Discuss the scope and feasibility of this work. For instance, what are the limits in your area of research? How far do you indent to follow this research question?
6. Discuss the prototype you developed to demonstrate feasibility, if relevant. Give an overview of its design and implementation. Discuss any data and existing software/libraries/tools that were necessary for the development of your prototype.
7. What evidence is there that the prototype will provide any support for your project? How will your prototype be helpful in the planning, execution and completion of your research project?
8. Discuss the experiment that you performed involving the prototype. What were the hypotheses and research question(s) of your experiment and what steps were taken to respond to them?
9. Discuss the results of the experiment. What was learned from applying these steps which will be helpful to the completion of your project and the achieving the main goals of your research project?
10. How did you explain and visualize your results from your experiment so that they could be understood by those who are not in your field of research? Explain how these visualizations could be used in your research project to help explain its foundations.
11. What ethical concerns are involved with your research? How will you recognize them and how will you handle them once they are apparent?
12. What are the next steps to develop and complete your research project.

### Overview of Tasks

**Commit log**: If your your GitHub commit log does not show continuous progression (no clusters of commits such as during the last few days of the project), then you will receive a full grade reduction for this project.

* **Part 1**: (Today, 13th July 2023): Begin planning and then complete and submit the outline for your research paper in `writing/outline.md`. At least one GitHub commit must be present at the conclusion of the class.

* **Part 2**: (Tuesday, 18th  July 2023): Peer interviews discussing the questions above to determine how each is addressed in the outline to build a working paper with a good flow that makes the reading more convenient.
Each interviewer is to submit a GitHub issue to their interviewee's repository to communicate their suggestions for improvement. Please note, these suggestions are to help ensure clarity and cohesiveness of the research document.

* **Part 3**: (Thursday, 20th July 2023): Project Walkthrough. Progress must be made toward the project, which can include code development and writing. During walkthrough, each student will lead a discussion and a demonstration of their progress.

* **Part 4**: (Tuesday, 25th April 2023): Work day to complete the writing assignment in `writing/paper.md`.

* **Part 5**: (Thursday, 27th July 2023): Poster presentation.

* **Part 6**: (Tuesday, 1st August 2023): Research paper and source code (if relevant) DUE.

## Project Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

**Note**: As you work in your writing documents, please be sure to remove the preamble text.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 5%]:**: For the repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct running of the program. An additional reduction will given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An addition reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of Technical Evaluation [up to 10%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the GitHub issue they create in peer's repository reveal a proficiency of technical evaluation of someone else's project. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted GitHub issue should have at least three suggestions for improvement that are relevant and beneficial to the project at hand. Additionally, the GitHub issue should have the correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate suggestions.

- **Mastery of Technical Work and Writing [up to 85%]:**: Students receive a grade in accordance with the writing cues presented in the `writing/outline.md` and `writing/paper.md` documents and any technical work accompanying the writing. The submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers. If the writing is based on source code, the program(s) must be correct and accurate.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`
