### Research Project Details

* What is the focus of your research project?

Build, design and implement a prototype using computer vision and machine learning to help doctors understand patients emotions, and degree of pain to aid in diagnosis of diseases in a virtual consultation.

* State at least one research question that your project will answer.

Can facial expressions be analyzed to draw out emotions to aid in better diagnosis in virtual consultation sessions between medical caregivers and patients?


* What are the steps you will need to take to complete this project?

PHASE 1:

- Finalize tools and datasets required for the project (Google Colab, python, image dataset, faker.ai, compencv)
- Conduct exploratory data analysis(Dependent, independent, missing data, outliers data inconsisencies)
- Establish emotion indices on face images from the internet
- Write code to arrive at approximate emotion states(happy, sad, angry, pained, neutral, etc.)
- Correlate emotions states with pain index
- Validate model and analyze model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)

PHASE 2:
- Source Video data
- Convert video to threaded images
- Repeat phase 1 analysis on video (accuracy of model, precision, etc)

PHASE 3: 
- Display model performance as graphs or visual comparison
- Write the paper

### Outline

* Introduction 

     + Motivation 
     - During covid times, my grandpa was admitted into the hospital and would not be treated fully until his covid test came back negative. 
     - Made me wonder if his treatment could be done online and diagnosis of the disease could aid in better medical care
     - This could also help people financially challenged, being able to talk to a doctor virtually for less money
     - During covid times we didnt want to take my grandpa to the hospital frequently to reduce risk of being exposed to COVID-19
     - Helps conectivity between a doctor patient (primary doctor/doctor the patient is used to)
     - Increases the availability of doctors so the ratio of doctors to patients increases

     + Current State of the Art 
     - Till now emotion detection has been used in several other fields
     - One paper talks about emotion recognition and facial detection to identify sleepy drivers
     - Emotion detection has been used to identify crime or fraud
     - Emotion detection in robotics, etc
     - Can this be used in virual medical diagnosis'?

     + Goals of the Project 
     - To see if emotion detection is feasible in order to aid in diagnosis of patients in a virtual interaction

* Related work 

* Method 

* Experiments
     + Assumptions
     - Patients have decent to good internet connection for the algorithm to run
     - Patients have a working camera
     - Lighting is manageable

     + Modeling Methadology 

     + Evaluation

     + Threats to Validity

* Conclusion

     + Summary of Results

     + Future Work
     - Extend the analysis to near real time video sessions (Facetime, Google Meet)

     + Ethical Implications and Recommendations
          - Patient has not given permission (HIPA rules)

     + Conclusions

     + References
