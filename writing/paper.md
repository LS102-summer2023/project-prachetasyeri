TODO: Text added to relevant sections below

### Introduction

TODO: This section describes your  research project, including the overall aims and the background motivating your research. Whenever possible, you should use one or more concrete examples and technical diagrams.

It is often useful and necessary to separate the introduction into multiple sections. Several possible sections are proposed below, you can use these or distribute your introductory text into sections in another way.

The headings below propose one way you might structure this section of the document.

#### Motivation

TODO

#### Current State of the Art

TODO

#### Goals of the Project

TODO

### Related work

TODO: This section includes a broad and detailed review of relevant existing work. The literature review should provide background and context for the reseach project work. The subsections may be organized in whatever manner seems best suited to the material-- chronological, or by topic, or according to some other criteria (e.g., primary versus secondary resources).

If ethical issues are central to this work, you should also address historical and contemporary issues or efforts made to address them.

### Prototype

TODO: This section describes the implemented prototype - how did you implement your prototype, including the overall design of your prototype, details of the algorithms and tools if any used, etc. Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

### Experiments

TODO: This section describes your experimental set up and evaluation. It should also produce and describe the results of your study. The subsection titles below offer a typical structure used for this section.

#### Experimental Design

TODO: Especially as it pertains to responsible computing, if conducting experiments or evaluations that involve particular ethical considerations, detail those issues here.

#### Evaluation

TODO

#### Threats to Validity

TODO: What are some considerations and choices you have made during your project that might compromise some of your presented results (for example, if you are using data could there be sources of data inaccuracy, or if you are relying on an existing tool or library, a potential inaccuracy in their work might result to inaccuracy in yours).

### Conclusion

TODO: Traditionally, this section addresses the areas proposed below as subsections, although not necessarily in this order or organized as offered.

#### Summary of Results

TODO

#### Future Work

TODO

#### Ethical Implications and Recommendations

TODO

#### Conclusions

TODO

#### References

TODO: Use IEEE format
